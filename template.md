E.g. a plant scientist approached Adelaide Microscopy with a need for bioimage analysis support. The researcher V wanted to count lesions and lesion area on leaves in images acquired using an iPhone. V had no prior image analysis experience.

It was clear from the dataset that traditional image segmentation techniques would not work as the data was unevenly illuminated, and the ... 

I suggested that she could use ilastik for simple 

## Dataset
V provided ### images of wheat leaves including control captured with iPhone ... camera. Images were 9000 x 6000 pixel RGB files 

## Tools
<!-- This section provides links to download the software/tools/scripts used in this bioimage analysis workflow -->
- ilastik: download an install ilastik on your computer [https://www.ilastik.org/download](https://www.ilastik.org/download)
- FIJI: download and install FIJI on your computer [https://imagej.net/software/fiji/downloads](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/downloads)
