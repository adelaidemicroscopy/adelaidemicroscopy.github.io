# Welcome!

<!-- My name is Bryant Roberts. I am a data specialist in Adelaide Microscopy, a core imaging facility at the University of Adelaide. In my role, I often support facility users with bioimage image analysis problems, including configuration of devices for use of many GPU-accelerated machine learning tools, e.g. stardist, cellpose, ilastik and others.

Along the way, I've documented my efforts based on mutilple resources such as forums, tutorials and official documentation to solve common image analysis problems. Until now, these step-by-step notes have lived on a personal drive. This blog is the accumulation of my efforts in a public resource.

My intention is to create clear, practical SOPs (standard operating procedures) for bioimage analysis workflows that can be shared not only with Adelaide Microscopy users, but with the wider scientific community. The focus is on accessiblitiy. 

Our main goal is to support biological and health and medical researchers, with non-engineering or computer science background, with accessible instructions so that they can access emerging bioimage analysis techniques as quickly as possible even in their own laboratories.

Disclaimer: The field of bioimage analysis is rapidly changing. The instruction provided here worked at the time it was written, on the device on which it was applied. No explicit guarantee is made that these instructions will work for you. Due to the nature of many open-source tools, particularly in management of software environments... If you encounter I suggest to review the image.sc forum or raise your own issue. I have found LLMs, such as ChatGPT, useful in troubleshooting issues that arise during installation of tools discussed on this site.

This is a small sample book to give you a feel for how book content is
structured.
It shows off a few of the major file types, as well as some sample content.
It does not go in-depth into any particular topic - check out [the Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org) for more information.
